Used pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and sklearn in python 3.7 to generate a MLR (Multi Linear Regression) model to predict house prices in Bangalore with 91.88% accuracy based on the following parameters - location, BHK size, number of baths and number of balconies.

The Data_filtering.png file in this repository depicts the process of filtering the data and setting up the final predictor and response variable(s) via a flowchart.

The Bangalore_house_predictor.ipynb file shows the cumulative process of extracting, filtering and analyzing the data to create the final MLR model.
